# KC ONLINE SCHOOL - My first Database project here at UCD Professional Academy.

### Introduction: Kevin Corcoran
I have done little bits of coding before and enjoyed it but have really enjoyed the challenges of this course. 
It has pushed me to out of my comfort zone and showed me what I'm capable of, I'm far from the finished article but 
hope that time will help me fill in the gaps. I have throughly enjoyed the challenges of the projects thus far.

**Who's our target demographic:**   
Anybody who works in admin at the KC ONLINE SCHOOL.

**What's the value:**

The value is is to manage the schools database, adding/editing students, courses and the courses attended by each individual student.

## The Scope Plane

### Requirements and Functional Specifications

**Owner Goals**
   - Make the app easy to navigate and use across all devices and screen sizes
   - To get right to the point on the landing page.
   - Have a register user section to add new users and a login area for existing users to log in.
   - Be able to function well to organise the students, courses and the courses that the students take
   - Have a responsive sign up form with the ability to see errors and submit

**First-time/Repeat User Goals**
   - Tomake it easy for the users to use and access the information that they need.
   - Have connectivity between the different database tables.


## The Structure Plane

### **Interaction Design**
   - **Consistent:** I tried to be consistent with the colors used, the layout of headings (navigation bar appears horizontally) and footers
   - **Predictable:** The layout consistency makes it predcictable how the next page should look
   - **Learnable:** Its predictability and simple navigation makes it easy to learn
   - **Visible:** Everything is clearly visible due to the mixture of colors and layout
   - **Feedback:** The forms and tables list have validations and errors to identity the issues or successes.

### **Information Archictecture**
The layout of the app was structured to proviude a user-friendly experience by allowing the user to move through the app freely and not get lost along the way. The header with has the navigation bar and dashboard is visible on the home page to make searching the app easy.

## The Skeleton Plane
I wanted the app to be structured in the most user-friendly way by add the right content in the right places. My hope would be that each page would be enough to have the user move to the next one.

The navigation was to be placed at the top of each page for simple movement.

## The Surface Plane

The surface and finshed look of the app is consistent across key areas. The color, color-contrast, layout, fonts and patterns are all examples of the consistency shown on the surface to the user providing a pleasing experience to the user. 

# Issues and Troubleshooting

Most issues were dealt with although being a first time designer of a database it was very challenging to make it work. Testing was required regularly. 

-----

# Testing 

All pages passed through the relevant validators at (https://validator.w3.org/) and (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and testing by the console for javascript, python testing was easily done on the app and I followed errors for help . 

It was also tested via multiple browsers and checked across multiple device types.
